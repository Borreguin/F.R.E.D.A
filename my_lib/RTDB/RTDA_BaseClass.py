"""
    This Abstract class contains abstract methods to deal with Data Acquisition.
    The abstract methods are declared, but contains no implementation. Abstract classes may not be instantiated,
    and its abstract methods must be implemented by its subclasses.

    ABCs introduce virtual subclasses, which are classes that donâ€™t inherit from arg_from class but are still
    recognized by isinstance() and issubclass() functions. The 'abc' module in Python library provides the
    infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes.

    'abc' works by marking methods of the base class as abstract. This is done by the following decorators:
        @absttractmethod
        @abstractclassmethod
        @abstractstatic

    A concrete class which is arg_from sub class of such abstract base class then implements the abstract base
    by overriding its abstract methods.

    To use this abstract class, you should implement all the abstract methods, so in this way it could be used
    in different contexts
